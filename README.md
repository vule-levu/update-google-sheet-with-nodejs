# update-google-sheet-with-nodejs

This is an example to update google sheet with nodejs every 5 second intervals. 
I use the bank services to signify the updates.
To use and run the code, you must have your credentials to google sheet services and have all the required libraries installed in advance as mentioned in the js files.

Enjoy the fun bit. Sharing is caring!
